        <h2>Arizona, USA</h2>
        <img src="images/az.jpg" alt="Arizona" width="300" height="200">
        <p>Arizona is one of the Warmer states in the United states, so most people would run away from the sun during summer time, but that doesn't make AZ not attractive as it is the 5th biggest town in the US, in having a historical place call the Gran Canyon one of the biggest canyons in the world. This natural landmark formed about five to six million years as erosion from the Colorado River cut a deep channel through layers of rock. The Grand Canyon contains some of the oldest exposed rock on Earth.</p>
