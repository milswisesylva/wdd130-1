        <p>Arizona is one of the warmest states of America if not the first one, during summer time many people step out of it in order to escape the heat, but you have to remember that Phoenix is the 5th Largest states in the US. Besides that we have the Gran Canyon that contains some of the oldest exposed rock on Earth.</p>
