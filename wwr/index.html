                <h2>History</h2>
                <p>Pigeon Forge was once part of North Carolina. Settlers first reached the area in 1788, when the area was governed by North Carolina. Pigeon Forge was the site of an iron forge built in 1820 by Isaac Love. His son built the Historic Old Mill in 1830. 
                    The other half of Pigeon Forgeâ€™s namesake is the passenger pigeon. Although passenger pigeons are now extinct, the community of Pigeon Forge preserves the memory of bygone era that brings to mind the rich diversity of life in the the wilderness frontier that was East Tennessee.
